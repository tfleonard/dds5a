# dds5a
This project is a DDS frequency synthesizer using a standard AD9850 module and the Transistor Tester commercially available (Chineese).  
It reprograms the Atmel 328p processor to drive the LCD and the DDS module.  Development was done on an Arduino Uno Rev 3.
The project uses Eclipse and the Source Forge plugin for AVR to build and download code.
